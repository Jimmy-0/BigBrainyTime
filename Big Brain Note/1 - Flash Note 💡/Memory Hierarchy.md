# RAM (Random Access Memory)
- Multiple RAM chips form a memory
- basic storage unit: cell (one bit per cell) 
  ## SRAM (static)
	- need more transistors -> higher cost
	- lower access time -> faster
	- more reliable -> less need for EDC(Error Detection and Correction)
	- No need to refresh
	- Application: Cache memories
- ## DRAM(dynamic)
	- Application: Main memories, frame buffers -> for graphic cards
# BUS Structure
- A bus is a collection of parallel wires that carry address, data and control signals. 
- Shared by multiple devices
chipsets VS IO bridge : a collection of chips separate from the process of the CPU chip 

PCI Express ?
