Elastic compute cloud / IaaS 
## Naming convention
`m5.2xlarge`
- m : instance class
- 5 : generation
- 2xlarge: size within the instance class
  
  ### Compute Optimized
- Btch processing workload
- Media transcoding
- HPC
- ML
- Gaming
### Memory Optimized
- High performance, SQL/non-SQL database
- distributed web cache
- In-memory database storage
- real-time processing of unstructured data 
### Storage Optimized
- High frequency online transaction processing system
- Cache of in-memory database 
- Data warehousing application
- Distributed file storage
### Security Groups
- Can be one to many 
- like the firewall 
- control the traffic in and out to the EC2 Instances 
- only contain allow rules
- rules can be referenced by IP or security group
- inbound traffic is blocked by default
- outbound traffic is allowed by default
- can be attached to multiple instances 
## Classic Port
`22` : SSH
`21` : FTP - upload into file share 
`22` : SFTP - upload files using SSH
`80` : HTTP - unsecured web
`443` : HTTPS - secured web
`3389` : RDP (Remote  Desktop Protocol)

## Elastic IP
- Every time we terminate an instance, the public IP will be deleted and we will be assigned a new one if we restart the instance 
- Elastic IP is for fixed public IP if you want to keep the IP 
### Placement Groups
strategy defined to control EC2 Instance
- Cluster : low-latency group in one single AZ, same rack, same AZ
- Spread: across underlying hardware, different AZ, more diverse but more latency, increase the availability 
- Partition : partitions within one AZ
## EC2 Hibernate
- available for On-demand, reserved and spot instances 
### ENI (Elastic Network Interface)
- attributes:  
	- Primary private IPv4, one or more secondary IPv4 â€¢ One Elastic IP (IPv4) per private IPv4  
	- One Public IPv4  
	- One or more security groups  
	- A MAC address
- bound to one AZ
