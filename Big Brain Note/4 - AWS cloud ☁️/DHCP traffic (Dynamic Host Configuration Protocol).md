A network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration settings to devices (clients) when they connect to a network. 

> 1. [Client] - DHCPDiscover -> [Server]
> 2. [Client] <- DHCPOffer - [Server]
> 3. [Client] - DHCPRequest -> [Server]
> 4. [Client] <- DHCPAck - [Server]

DHCP traffic is an essential part of network management, as it automates the process of IP address assignment and simplifies network administration. It ensures that devices can easily and dynamically obtain the necessary network configuration settings without manual configuration, making it particularly useful in large and dynamic network environments.
